        Nowadays, spices are mostly used in cooking for their flavor and incredible health <br>
        benefits (see "health"). All of the flavors that we know and love come from a <br>
        combination of spices that compliment each other. Kentucky Fried Chicken? The 11 <br>
        herbs and spices are to thank for the Colonel's legendary chicken. The signature <br>
        spice blend has become so popular that KFC started selling firewood scented with <br>
        it! This example shows how powerful spices are when it comes to flavoring food. <br>

        Spices have been used for thousands of years to preserve food. Cumin, black pepper,<br>
        ginger, mustard seeds and salt (the most widely used spice for preservation) are the <br>
        most commonly used spices for preservation and for a reason: when used heavily, their <br>
        antibacterial properties can be powerful enough to eliminate plant and human pathogens. <br>
        Before modern inventions like the refrigerator and freezer, preservation was the best <br>
        way to store food for long periods of time without the risk of it being spoiled by <br>
        bacteria and pathogens, especially when it came to meat and fish.
